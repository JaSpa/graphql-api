Sketch of GraphQL stuff

## What it is

Aim is to be [servant](http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/) for GraphQL.

To do this, we're going to need:

* GraphQL language
  * Query language definition
  * Type / schema definition
  * Parsing
* Evaluation
* Value-level definition of queries and schemas
* Type-level definition of queries and schemas

## Why you might want it

Right now, you don't. We're working on it. Please feel free to contribute by
filing issues & submitting PRs.
